# Hello, and welcome to the Software Reverse Engineering Repository of my Academic Projects🖐️

Learned how reverse engineering is used to create missing documentation to support legacy software. Learned how to turn a binary into assembly language which can then be translated into functional C++ code and vice versa. Utilized tools such as Hex editor to help decipher what the program is intended to do by reading variable data. Learned how to address security vulnerabilities in legacy software using reverse engineering techniques.
